5-10 pages incl. Figures

No collaboration

%Dataset 1: Simple. No zeros. Maybe look up usage of antibitoics in each country.

Dataset 2: Simple. No zeros. Look up metadata: cc, hc, lc \newline


%Dataset 3: Medium. Last column: metadata. Lots of zeros. Maybe mislabelling because of mistakes from people handling the data.\newline
%
%\textbf{Diet of African Hominidae}
%Fecal metagenomes from Chimps and human children from Africa. Samples have been mapped against a mitochondrial database and a subset of genera is given as parts. 2 genera refer to the host and the rest are assumed to refer to the diet. Lots of zeros and possibly mismappings and mislabelled samples. Complexity: medium \newline
%\textbf{ideas}
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Try to check how many has homo/pan ration close to 1 
%  \item  Try to reduce the parts by amalgamating, so ternary 
%    plot can be produced 
%  \item  
%\end{itemize}
%
%Dataset 4: Medium. ASD: Autistic Spectrum Disorders. Counts to bacterial species/genera. Zeros. A and B are ASD-group and control-group (we don’t know which is which). Obvious for ANOVA. \newline
%
%Dataset 5: Complex. Structural zeros.
%
%Dataset 6: Complex. Requires knowledge about Pokemon… ANOVA is not good here (not one Pokemon significantly better than the other)
%
%Dataset 7: Complex. Global top 20 songs. Number of plays in each country. Zeros = not in the national top 200. Below-the-measuring-kind-of-zero.
