\section{Notes}

Deadline: 12/5 kl. 14

5-10 pages incl. Figures

No collaboration


The hand-in should be emailed directly to me. The report should be a pdf or Word doc (or something similar), 5-10 pages long, including figures and tables but excluding code. I do not want to see your code, but if you must show it to me, attach the code as an appendix (which goes beyond the 5-10 pages).\newline

You are free to choose what you want to do with the dataset, as long as it falls within the scope of the course. Not all the analyses that we have discussed during lectures are relevant for all datasets, so choose something you find relevant. Maybe you need to zero-replace and maybe you want to apply closure. You most definitely want to log-ratio transform the data, but which transform you will use is up to you (depending on what you will use it for). Maybe you want to do a PCA or maybe fit a linear model or work on a sub-composition in a ternary diagram. You decide and remember that more is not necessarily better. The success criterion is that you draw some kind of (correct) conclusions on the data. Every exam dataset has been made to have some discoverable effects in them.   \newline



Dataset 2: Simple. No zeros. Look up metadata: cc, hc, lc \newline
